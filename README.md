# Final Project

For this project, we created a university database management system, for anyone within the system to be able to access and view the information specific to their roles. This includes both the students and members of staff such as professors and admins. Ever since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic which caused a stop to all in-person activities, new educational software that can maintain University and course-specific information for both students and instructors to view was suddenly a necessity. We used the current educational software for our University (Canvas) as inspiration for this database. The database from the perspective of the professors helps them with a few things. They can view their own profile, the classes they are teaching, and classes they have taught in previous semesters/years. In terms of student information, they can edit and view overall student grades, as well as access other student information such as their IDs, their grades for each assignment, their submissions.
